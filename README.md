# Contact Management System - Data Structure Performance Comparison

Code Execution link - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uT-ekyeS9uOck6MY4uD4HgX-dt1zWW6_?usp=sharing

## üìã Assignment Overview

This project implements and compares the performance of four different data structures in the context of a contact management system:

1. **Array-based List** - Dynamic array implementation
2. **Singly Linked List** - Node-based linked structure
3. **Hash Map** - Dictionary-based key-value storage
4. **Binary Search Tree (BST)** - Tree-based sorted structure

##  Learning Objectives

- Understand the trade-offs between different data structures
- Analyze theoretical vs. empirical time complexity
- Learn to benchmark and profile code performance
- Practice implementing fundamental data structures
- Gain experience with real-world performance testing

##  Features

### Data Structures Implemented

| Data Structure | Insert | Search | Delete | Update | Space |
|---------------|--------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| Array         | O(1)*  | O(n)    | O(n)   | O(n)   | O(n)  |
| Linked List   | O(1)   | O(n)    | O(n)   | O(n)   | O(n)  |
| Hash Map      | O(1)*  | O(1)*   | O(1)*  | O(1)*  | O(n)  |
| BST           | O(log n)*| O(log n)*| O(log n)*| O(log n)*| O(n) |

*Average case; worst case may differ

### Operations Tested

- **Insert**: Adding new contacts to the system
- **Search**: Finding contacts by name
- **Update**: Modifying contact information (phone/email)
- **Delete**: Removing contacts from the system

### Performance Metrics

- **Execution Time**: Measured in milliseconds with high precision
- **Scalability**: Tested with datasets of 100, 1K, 5K, and 10K contacts
- **Statistical Analysis**: Multiple trials with mean and spread calculations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Implicit through data structure design

##  Running Tests

### Complete Performance Analysis
```bash
python contact_manager.py
```

This will:
- Generate synthetic contact data
- Test all operations on all data structures
- Create performance visualizations
- Save results to CSV file
- Display comprehensive analysis report

### Basic Operations Demo
```python
# Add this to the end of contact_manager.py and uncomment
demo_basic_operations()
```

## üìà Expected Results

Based on theoretical analysis, you should observe:

1. **Hash Map** excels at all operations with O(1) average performance
2. **BST** provides balanced performance with O(log n) operations
3. **Array** is efficient for insertions but slow for searches/deletions
4. **Linked List** is fast for insertions but slow for other operations

## üìù Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Code Implementation 
- Complete implementation of all four data structures
- Proper error handling and edge case management
- Clean, well-documented code with type hints

### 2. Performance Analysis 
- Run performance tests with provided datasets
- Generate and analyze visualization graphs
- Document empirical results vs. theoretical expectations

### 3. Written Report 
Use the provided `report_template.md` to write a 2-3 page analysis covering:
- Design decisions and implementation details
- Performance comparison and analysis
- Real-world application implications
- Conclusions and recommendations

### 4. Visualizations 
- Performance comparison graphs (automatically generated)
- Analysis of scaling behavior
- Identification of performance bottlenecks


##  Visualization Features

The program automatically generates:
- Line plots showing performance scaling
- Logarithmic scaling for operations with wide performance ranges
- Error bars showing measurement uncertainty
- Professional styling with clear legends and labels

### Performance Notes

- BST performance depends on insertion order (can degrade to O(n) in worst case)
- Hash map performance assumes good hash function and load factor
- Large datasets may require significant memory and processing time
